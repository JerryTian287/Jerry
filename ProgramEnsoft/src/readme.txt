This algorithm is designed based on bfs of graph. The routes from each start(points from peggy’s side) to each end(points from sam’s side) is calculated with bfs, and all the nodes on the routes are added to a list, where duplicated nodes will be deleted. The nodes that should avoid are not even added to the graph since it will not influence the result and can reduce the complicity. According to the description of this problem, any of the nodes on the route from Peggy to Sam can be the place for lunch, thus this problem will be finished after we save the nodes from output list to the output file, as shown in my program.
